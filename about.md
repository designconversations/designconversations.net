*Design Conversations* is a podcast series aimed at recording an oral
history of designers and design practices in Australia, from the
20<sup>th</sup> century to the present day.

Each episode is a one-on-one conversation with an eminent design
practitioner, in which they detail and elaborate on their careers. The
series strives to cover most of the design disciplines currently
practiced, and examine the motivation, inspiration and hard work that
brought recognition.

conversations, or the [Topics](/topics/) page to view episodes grouped
by design topics. To be notified of new episodes, subscribe to the

series.
