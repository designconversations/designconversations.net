*Design Conversations* is a podcast series aimed at recording an oral
history of designers and design practices in Australia, from the
20<sup>th</sup> century to the present day.

Each episode is a one-on-one conversation with an eminent design
practitioner, in which they detail and elaborate on their careers. The
series strives to cover most of the design disciplines currently
practiced, and examine the motivation, inspiration and hard work that
brought recognition.

Visit the [Episodes](/episodes) page to view the full list of
conversations, or the [Topics](/topics) page to view episodes grouped
by design topics. To be notified of new episodes, subscribe on your 
favourite [podcast platform](#podcast-platforms) or subscribe to the 
*Design Conversations* mailing list via the form at the foot of this 
page.

Thank you for your interest—I hope you enjoy and find value in the
series.
