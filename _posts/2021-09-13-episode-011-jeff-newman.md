Jeffrey Newman is an industrial designer, who trained in the fourth intake of
students for the Industrial Design Diploma at RMIT in the mid 1950s. Jeff
established his initial freelance design practice immediately after graduation,
and later, following a period at Thorn Electrical, he eventually accepted a
position in Myer Store Planning under Don Ward.

His passion for good design and its promotion led him to join the Industrial
Design Council of Australia, and he would become its State Director in both
South Australia and New South Wales. He was intimately involved in the Prince
Phillip Design Awards and wrote on design issues and broadcast about design on
Radio Australia. He also had a successful career in retail design with Witchery
and worked with the Australian Council for the Arts. A passionate advocate for
Australian design, he worked creatively and tirelessly to promote the profession
throughout mid-century Australia.
