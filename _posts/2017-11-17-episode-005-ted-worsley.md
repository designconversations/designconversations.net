Ted Worsley was a student in Australia’s inaugural Industrial Design course
commencing in 1947. The Industrial Design Diploma at Melbourne Technical College
(now RMIT University) was also attended by Clem Meadmore, later to become an
internationally renowned sculptor.

He established Stuart Furniture in South Yarra with fellow student Jack Crow,
and later went into design education at Chisholm (now Monash University) as Head
of School. Ted also served on the Industrial Design Council in Melbourne. He was
a member of the first class in the inaugural Diploma of Industrial Design at the

the establishment of the first design body in Australia, the Society of
Designers for Industry and later became its first national secretary. After
engaging in furniture retailing and supply, he entered into education and was a
significant influence at Prahran Technical School (later to become Swinburne
University) and Chisholm Technical College (later to become Monash University).
