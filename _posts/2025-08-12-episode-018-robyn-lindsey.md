Robyn Lindsey is an interior and experience designer with over four decades of
practice across retail, corporate, hospitality and residential sectors. She
studied Interior Design at RMIT and holds an MBA in Entrepreneurial Studies from
Swinburne. From 1990 she spent three decades at Geyer Design, progressing to
Director and Partner and serving as Global Strategy and Design Leader overseeing
the firm's expansion into Asia. In 2021 she established her own independent
practice. She was recognised with a Lifetime Achievement in the 2020
Architecture and Design Sustainability Awards.

In this conversation Robyn traces her path from a rural childhood through
formative experiences at RMIT that shaped how she thinks about space and the
built environment. Early roles led her into sustainability work—notably
Victoria's first publicly displayed low‑energy house—and public education,
establishing her conviction that design can influence behaviour. She discusses
translating brand into experience for clients including East Coast Fashion,
Ansett Airlines, Vodafone NZ and major banks, and her later decision to return
to hands‑on design through a smaller, values‑aligned practice.
