    <p>Design Conversations is a podcast series aimed at recording an oral history of designers and design practices in
    Australia, from the twentieth century to the present day.</p>
    <p>Each episode is a one-on-one conversation with an eminent design practitioner, in which they detail and elaborate
    on their careers. The series strives to cover most of the design disciplines currently practiced, and examine the
    motivation, inspiration and hard work that brought recognition.</p>
