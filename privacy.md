This Privacy Policy explains what information the *Design Conversations*
website collects about our visitors and what we do with that
information.

## Scope of Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through
your use of the *Design Conversations* website (designconversations.net).

## Website visitors

Like most website operators, *Design Conversations* collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
is to better understand how our visitors use the website.

*Design Conversations* also collects potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such
information to identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose such
information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and
disclose personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of personally-identifying information

Certain visitors to the *Design Conversations* website choose to
interact with it in ways that require us to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
ask subscribers to our newsletter to provide a name and email address.
In each case, *Design Conversations* collects such information only as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
interaction with us. We do not disclose personally-identifying
information other than as described below. And visitors can always
refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
activities.

## Protection of certain personally-identifying information

*Design Conversations* will not rent or sell potentially 
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

If you are a registered user of *Design Conversations* newsletter and
have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email
to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
up to date with what’s going on with *Design Conversations*. We
primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we
expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.

*Design Conversations* takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
against the unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each
time the visitor returns. *Design Conversations* uses cookies to help
identify and track visitors, their usage of the website, and their
website access preferences. Website visitors who do not wish to have
cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
cookies before using our website, with the drawback that certain
features of the website may not function properly without the aid of
cookies.

## Privacy Policy changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, *Design Conversations* may
change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and at our sole discretion.
We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
